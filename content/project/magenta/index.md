`magenta` is an individual-based simulation model of malaria epidemiology and parasite genetics, which was designed to extends the Imperial malaria model by tracking the infection history of individuals. With this addition, genetic characteristics of the parasite can be assessed for looking at both neutral genetic variation as well as loci under selection.

The first and main research paper based on this project was published in MBE[^1], which showed the extenet to which parasite genetic traits could be used to infer malaria transmission intensity.
