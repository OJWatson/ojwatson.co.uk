Individual based malaria transmission model for the study of *P. falciparum* *pfhrp2* gene deletions - `hrp2malaRia`. The model is an extension of the Imperial College transmission model used as part of the [Global Technical Strategy 2030 costing exercise](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00423-5/fulltext), and was used to characterise the drivers of *pfhrp2* deletion selection in the following publication:

 > Watson OJ, Slater HC, Verity R, et al. Modelling the drivers of the spread of Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 gene deletions in sub-Saharan Africa. Elife 2017; 6: e25008. (https://elifesciences.org/articles/25008)
