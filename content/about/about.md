# About

I'm a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine working with [Prof Francesco Checchi](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/checchi.francesco) on mortality estimation. I also am Visiting Researcher in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, working with [Prof Azra Ghani](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.ghani) and [Dr Patrick Walker](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/patrick.walker06) on modelling the transmission of COVID-19, and hold a position at Brown University in the [Bailey Lab](http://www.baileylab.org/) working on malaria population genetics.  

My undergraduate degree was in Natural Sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge before completing a master's degree in Systems Biology, working on multi-omic computational methods for identifying new biochemical reactions indicative of disease.

For my PhD I worked on integrating genetic information into malaria transmission modelling with Prof Azra Ghani, Dr Lucy Okell and Dr Robert Verity. This work was focussed on extending malaria transmission models that have been used in creating global technical strategies for malaria control by including parasite genetic information to answer policy questions related to pfhrp2/3 deletions and antimalarial resistance.
