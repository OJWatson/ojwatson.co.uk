  I am a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) working at the intersection of infectious disease modelling and mortality estimation. I am motivated by reducing global health inequalities, using my skills as a data scientist, epidemiologist and an R developer to address key policy questions related to the control of malaria and COVID-19. 

  I am currently conducting my fellowship at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Before that I completed postdoctoral research at Brown University and completed my DPhil in Infectious Disease Modelling at Imperial College London on a Wellcome Trust funded PhD.
