  I am an Imperial College Research Fellow supported by an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship, working within Imperial's new AI Initiative: [I-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/). My primary focus is as an infectious disease modeller, data scientist, epidemiologist and an R developer. My academic work has focussed on modelling the spread of malaria and COVID-19, based at Imperial College London, Brown University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

  I am a Lecturer and Imperial College Research Fellow supported by an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship at Imperial College London. I currently work within Imperial's new AI Initiative, [I-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/), and am a member of the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/) and work at the intersection of infectious disease modelling and mortality estimation. 
  
  I am motivated by reducing global health inequalities, using my skills as a data scientist, epidemiologist and an R developer to generate sustainable systems for improving data equity and using these to address key policy questions related to food insecurity and the control of infectious diseases, such as malaria and COVID-19. 

  Previously, I was a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Before that I completed postdoctoral research at Brown University and completed my PhD in Infectious Disease Modelling at Imperial College London on a Wellcome Trust funded PhD.
